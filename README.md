PROJECT: Sylphie consists on an all-in-one web system that could automate SAP functions and integrate with data science tools.

development roadmap:

STEP 1 (actual) -> consists on creating a frontend with streamlit that automates some SAP pricing functions and manipulates files on your machine. It runs price verifications and validates business rules.

STEP 2 - > create dashboards about these procedures and their consequences.

STEP 3 - > integrate steps 1 and 2 by creating indicators and defining pricing rules that could be used to suggest new prices for your products based on your statements.

SAP version used is legacy (~2010), so it will use a lot of .vbs and weird things.

Stacks involved on project at now:

VTEX (ecom platform)
Pleno (shop system)
SAP (legacy)
Streamlit
Pandas
Openpyxl
Oracle DB (to extract some info)
PostgreSQL (project's official's database)
