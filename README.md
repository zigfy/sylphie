PROJECT: Sylphie consists on an all-in-one web system that could automate SAP functions and integrate with data science tools.

development roadmap:

STEP 1 (actual) -> consists on create a frontend with streamlit that automate some SAP pricing functions and manipulate files on your machine.

STEP 2 - > create dashboards using SAP extractions as basis.

STEP 3 - > integrate STEP 1 and 2 by creating indicators and defining pricing rules that could run with scheduling.


SAP version used is legacy (~2010) so it will use a lot of .vbs and weird things.
